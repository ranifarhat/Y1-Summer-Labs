# Strings Operations & Functions Lab

## Objective: 
In this lab, you will learn how to use **strings FUNctions**, as well as make sure you grasp the idea of **Input/Output** a bit more!

> Before we start, make sure to create a new file (in **Repl.it**) and call it **"Strings2Lab"**.  
> And save it in **"Day 3"** folder!

## Instructions:

### 1) Operations : 
1. **With a partner**, take a look at these lines and try to guess in 60 seconds what each line does:
    - `"Multiply" * 3`
    - `"add" + "2"`
    - `"add" + 3`
    - `"hi" * 3 + "bye" * 4`
    - `"hi".upper()`
    
2. In the **python editor**, try printing the lines above.
    - Were your answers correct?

---
### 2) Input/Output: 
1. Make a variable named `user` that takes `input` from the user. Like this:
```python
user = input("Say something! ")
```
    
2. Now write three **print** statements that repeat what the user says back to them using `.upper()`, `.lower()`, and `.swapcase()`.


---
### 3) Greetings: 

1. Using `input()`, Write a program that asks "What's your name?" and stores your name in a **variable**. Be sure to name your variable something that makes sense and is easy to remember, like: `name`.

2. Add a line at the end of the program that **prints** `"Hello there, "` followed by your name. 
    - Your program should look something like this:

3. Use some of the methods we learned to make sure that when the computer **prints** out your name, the **first letter** is always capitalized, even if you typed in all lowercase. Run your program to test it out. 
    - Remember you can ask your partner for help if you have trouble!

4. Find the **length** of the name, and store this number in a **variable**. 

5. Add another line to your program that prints `"Your name is (length) letters long!"`.

6. Do you remember **indexing**? Add another line to the program that **prints** out `"The first letter of your name is [first letter] and the last letter is [last letter]."` 
    - Capitalize both of the letters.
    - Example: If `name` was `Loai`, the program should print `"The first letter of your name is L and the last letter is I."`


7. Test that your code works for **ANY** name by trying a few *different* names.
    - You can even ask a neighbor to write out name suggestions to help you in testing!
